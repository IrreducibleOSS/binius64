//! Gate fusion optimization.
//!
//! The main cost of our system is coming from the number of AND constraints. The less we have the
//! cheaper it is.
//!
//! Our AND constraints are powerful construct construct. They can handle a single AND of two XOR
//! combinations where each of the values could be shifted.
//!
//! `ConstraintBuilder` which this pass operates consists of AND, MUL and linear constraints. Linear
//! constraints are basically are constraints that define a single wire using a XOR combination
//! and/or shifts. Since our system does not suppose standalone linear combinations they will have
//! to be promoted to AND constraints.
//!
//! BUT we have a chance of avoiding that if we manage to inline that wire into every consumer
//! constraint which means we don't have to commit that value and thus we don't need an AND
//! constraint!
